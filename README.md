# Dev Test
by ana lee. 

## Few notes : 
First of all, thank you Tech Directors for taking your time to review my code! 
I had a lot of fun creating this page especially because I used some of their products! (and I loved itâœ¨)

Unfortunately, I was not able to complete the whole project. 
I wanted to keep it under 4 hours and still showcase all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skillset. 

However, if I had more time I would .. 

- complete the desktop layout
- build navigation drop down menu 
- update mobile version using media queries 
- + many more features!
